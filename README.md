# non-preemtive-scheduling

Implementing non-preemptive scheduling on Unix/Linux operating systems - Fall 2020
- Implemented routines that will allow a program to run with multiple threads, using TCB (thread control block) and queues.
- The same routines were then implemented using P and V operations of semaphore and then further modified the routines to implement
the reader/writer problem.
